# What's a Ransomware?

A ransomware is a type of malware that prevents legitimate users from accessing their device or data and asks for a payment in exchange for the stolen functionality. They have been used for mass extortion in various forms, but the most successful one seems to be encrypting ransomware: most of the user data are encrypted and the key can be obtained paying the attacker. To be widely successful a ransomware must fulfill three properties:

Property 1: The hostile binary code must not contain any secret (e.g. deciphering keys). At least not in an easily retrievable form, indeed white box cryptography can be applied to ransomware.

Property 2: Only the author of the attack should be able to decrypt the infected device.

Property 3: Decrypting one device can not provide any useful information for other infected devices, in particular the key must not be shared among them.
